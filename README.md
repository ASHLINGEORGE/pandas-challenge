## Overview

This project involves analyzing the academic performance of a school district. We will be using data from various schools to gain insights into factors affecting student success. The dataset includes information on school types, budgets, student scores, and more. We will conduct analyses to understand the following aspects of the school district:


## District Summary

- Total number of unique schools
- Total students
- Total budget
- Average math score
- Average reading score
- % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
- % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
- % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

## School Summary

- School name
- School type
- Total students
- Total school budget
- Per student budget
- Average math score
- Average reading score
- % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
- % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
- % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

## Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)

- The top 5 schools with the highest overall passing rates

## Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)

- The 5 schools with the lowest overall passing rates

## Math Scores by Grade

- Average math score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school

## Reading Scores by Grade

- Average reading score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school

## Scores by School Spending

- School performance based on average spending ranges (per student)

## Scores by School Size

- School performance categorized by school size (small, medium, or large)

## Scores by School Type

- School performance categorized by school type (Charter or District)
## Conclusion

In an education landscape where student success and resource efficiency are paramount, charter schools shine as beacons of academic excellence, boasting an impressive overall passing rate of 90.43%. Meanwhile, district schools grapple with challenges in resource allocation and teaching methods, resulting in a significantly lower overall passing rate at 53.67%. These disparities underscore the need for a comprehensive evaluation of education policies and the potential benefits of implementing successful charter school strategies in district schools to enhance overall academic performance.
